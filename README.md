   ```

## üéØ Quick Start

### Using the Enhanced GUI (Recommended)

1. **Launch the GUI**
   ```bash
   python Value_AnalysisGUI.py
   ```

2. **Configure the analysis**:
   - Annual Report Folder: select the PDF folder (optional)
   - Company Configuration: set company details (name, ticker, exchange)
   - Perplexity Settings: API key, model, search classifier, years
   - Extraction Mode: Disabled | AI/ML | Standard
   - Overwrite Policy: allow extraction to overwrite Perplexity
   - Reference Fundamentals: JSON/CSV/Markdown (supports eps, roe, pe); optional overwrite
   - Valuation Overrides: Discount Rate (WACC), Safety Margin Low/High

3. **Click "Run Analysis"** and monitor the progress in the log window

### Data Flow and Merge Policy

- Perplexity is mandatory and primary. It is fetched first and used as the source of truth.
- Annual report extraction is optional and controlled by the GUI `Extraction Mode`:
  - `disabled` (default): no PDF extraction; report uses Perplexity only.
  - `ai`: AI/ML extractor runs on PDFs.
  - `standard`: enhanced regex/table extractor runs on PDFs.
- Merge behavior is controlled by `Extraction can overwrite Perplexity`:
  - Off (default): extractor only fills years Perplexity does not have or where its value is null.
  - On: extractor may replace overlapping years from Perplexity when it has values.
- The report shows up to the most recent 10 years and preserves units/currency in `eps_data['units']`.

#### Reference Fundamentals Upload (Optional)

You can upload your own reference EPS/ROE file to serve as a cross-check. It does not need to contain 10 full years; any subset is accepted. By default, extracted values remain primary. You may optionally overwrite extracted years with your reference for the years provided.

GUI controls (left panel):

- Reference & Validation (optional)
  - Reference file: JSON, CSV, or Markdown (.md)
  - Fields: eps, roe, pe (per year)
  - Overwrite extracted values with reference file: optional

Command-line environment variables (advanced):

```
ENABLE_EXTERNAL_VALIDATION=false
REFERENCE_FUNDAMENTALS_PATH=path\to\reference.json
OVERWRITE_WITH_REFERENCE=false
```

Supported formats:

- JSON (recommended)
  - Structure:
    - eps: mapping of year -> numeric EPS
    - roe: mapping of year -> numeric ROE (percentage number without % sign)
    - units (optional):
      - eps_unit: "dollars" or "cents"
      - currency: currency code like "SGD" or "USD"
      - roe_unit (optional): "percentage"

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "eps": {
    "2016": 0.22,
    "2017": 0.25,
    "2018": 0.23,
    "2019": 0.27
  },
  "roe": {
    "2016": 12.3,
    "2017": 14.1,
    "2018": 11.5,
    "2019": 13.2
  },
  "units": {
    "eps_unit": "dollars",
    "currency": "SGD",
    "roe_unit": "percentage"
  }
}
```

- CSV / Markdown
  - Required columns: year, eps, roe
  - Optional: pe, currency, eps_unit, roe_unit

Example CSV:

```csv
year,eps,roe
2016,0.22,12.3
2017,0.25,14.1
2018,0.23,11.5
2019,0.27,13.2
```

Behavior:

- Partial years are fine; used for cross-validation only.
- If overwrite is enabled, only overlapping years in your file will replace extracted values; all other years remain from extraction.
- EPS unit and currency handling: prefer JSON and set units to ensure clarity (dollars vs cents and currency).

### Perplexity Fundamentals

- Mandatory first source for up to 10-year EPS/ROE with citations.
- Env flags:
  - `MCP_PERPLEXITY_ENABLED=true|false`
  - `MCP_OVERWRITE_WITH_PERPLEXITY=true|false`
  - `MCP_YEARS=10`
  - `PERPLEXITY_MAX_TOKENS=4000`
- Artifacts:
  - Fundamentals: `perplexity_raw_response.json`, `mcp_perplexity_fundamentals.json`
  - PE history: `perplexity_raw_response_pe.json`, `perplexity_parsed_content_pe.txt`, `perplexity_last_error_pe.txt`


The system now supports three extraction modes via GUI:

1. **Disabled**: Skip annual report extraction; use Perplexity only.
2. **AI/ML Extraction**: Uses advanced AI/ML methods for more robust extraction.
3. **Standard Extraction**: Uses enhanced regex/table strategies.
